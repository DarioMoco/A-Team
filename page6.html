      <h3>Machine Learning,Cybersecurity,Cloud Services and Blockchain and Criptocurrency</h3>

      <p>Machine learning making machines to act as a humans or to act as a help for a human. In order to be successful it needs loads of data and that’s exactly where machine learning, blockchain and data clouds can help each other.
Even though the strong security can be maintained through blockchain need for cyber security is evident in this circle of mutual dependency.
All technologies mentioned above are relatively new technologies with very strong impact on everyday life,especially blockchain and machine learning.
Blockchain is a technology which allows big data collection in autonomous manner and also through Blockchain properties like smart contracts it’s easy to control security and rights over data used.
This intersects data clouds,blockchain and machine learning.</p>
<p>This combination can be beneficial in financial and insurances purposes where fraud can be prevented by combination of smart contracts with machine learning execution of actions and contracts.
Blockchain can be used as a cloud service  and there is more and more demand for such a service since security and accessibility property of blockchain technology offers great results.</p>
</p>Adding to that possibility for all transactions to be done without bank or government rules and fees, and under mutually agreed contract, through criptocurrency as way of payment, this gives us a clear picture what’s waiting for us in the future.
There is a lot of companies who are trading their hdd storage spaces for their own criptocurrency with their customers.
Some of these are working on smart contract basis where cryoptocurrency is used to pay the storage.Since the storage is scattered all over the internet there is no way that someone can hack into data stored in blockchain.
Cybersecurity also can be defated by blockchain technologies especially when blockchain in based in decentralized networks which makes it absolutely not possible to be harmed by outside attacks. Built-in security features based on encryption, decentralization, and agreement principles are more stronger than any multilayered cybersecurity protection.</p>

<p>Also AI through machine lerning can have a huge impact on cybersecurity through various AI applications for security purposes just by analizing massive amount of possible risk data.
That also gives a connection to a cloud services where all the data is stored and where future data will be stored.
One of the biggest imperatives for huge amounts of data stored is security of them and how it’s managed to be saved from any sort of attack.
As mentioned above it can be done by various layers of cyber security protection but also by blockchain technologies of decentralized networks and contracts.</p>

<p>All these mentioned technologies are intercepting and can benefitital for one another.
Lets take a closer look at each separately.</p>

<p>What is machine learning and what does it do?</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence or also known as Machine learning is a constellation of many different technologies working together to enable machines to sense, comprehend, act, and learn with human-like levels of intelligence. Maybe that’s why it seems as though everyone’s definition of artificial intelligence is different: AI isn’t just one thing.</p>



<p>Technologies like machine learning and natural language processing are all part of the AI landscape. Each one is evolving along its own path and, when applied in combination with data, analytics and automation, can help businesses achieve their goals, be it improving customer service or optimizing the supply chain.</p>



<p>Some go even further to define artificial intelligence as “narrow” and “general” AI. Most of what we experience in our day-to-day lives is narrow AI, which performs a single task or a set of closely related tasks. Examples include:</p>



<p>Weather apps</p>

<p>Digital assistants</p>

<p>Software that analyzes data to optimize a given business function</p>

<p>These systems are powerful, but the playing field is narrow: They tend to be focused on driving efficiencies. But, with the right application, narrow AI has immense transformational power—and it continues to influence how we work and live on a global scale.</p>

<p>Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science. Using statistical methods, algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions, uncovering key insights within data mining projects. These insights subsequently drive decision making within applications and businesses, ideally impacting key growth metrics. As big data continues to expand and grow, the market demand for data scientists will increase, requiring them to assist in the identification of the most relevant business questions and subsequently the data to answer them.</p>



<p>Machine learning works in many ways, most of the commonly known ways that Machine learning works is</p>

<p>A Decision Process: In general, machine learning algorithms are used to make a prediction or classification based on samples of input data, which can be labelled or unlabeled, your algorithm will produce an estimate about a pattern in the data.</p>


<p>An Error Function: An error function serves to evaluate the prediction of the model, if there are known examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess the accuracy of the model from this the data will be given back to the Programmer/User to inform them of the evaluation.</p>


<p>Model Optimization Process: if the model can fit better to the data points in the training set, then weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the known example and the model estimate. The algorithm will repeat this evaluation and optimize the process to what it feels is the best way to operate at, which means updating weights autonomously until a threshold of accuracy has been met.</p>

<p>Some of the ways that Machine learning works is in the type of learning methods we use these learning methods fall into 3 Class categories.</p>

<p>Supervised machine learning: Supervised machine learning is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that classify data or predict outcomes accurately as input data is fed into the model, it adjusts its weights until the model has been fitted appropriately, this occurs as part of the cross evaluation process to ensure that the model avoids overfitting or underfitting, The supervised learning helps organizations solve a variety of real-world problems at a scale, such as classifying spam in separate folder from your inbox, some methods used in supervised learning include neural networks, Naïve bayes, linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine( also known as SVM), and many more one of the well known companies that use SML(Supervised Machine Learning) to this day is Google in a lot of its services like Gmail, Google Doc, and many other services that google provides.</p>

<p>Unsupervised machine learning: Unsupervised machine learning uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets, these algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention, its ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it the ideal solution for exploratory data analysis (PCA) and other singular value decomposition (SVD) are two common approaches for this, Other algorithms used in unsupervised learning include Neural networks, k-means clustering, probabilistic clustering methods, and more.</p>


<p>Semi-supervised machine learning: Semi-supervised machine learning offers a happy to medium between supervised and unsupervised learning experience during training, It uses a smaller labeled data set to guide classification and feature extraction from a larger, unlabeled data set (or not being able to afford to label enough data) to train a supervised learning algorithm.</p>



<p>What is the Likely Impact of Machine Learning?</p>



<p>The best way to describe the likely impact of machine learning is to look at the current impact it has and the effects it’s having in daily lives.</p>

<p>Almost everything coming out of the technology world these days seems to have an element of artificial intelligence or machine learning (ML) in it. ML today is the implementation of some aspects of human abilities but certainly not the entire potential for human intelligence. ML enables people to accomplish more by collaborating with smart software. It is like putting more human face to technology. The whole world is debating the consequence of AI/ML and how it will impact our future.</p>

<p>Machine learning has been used in lots of ways to help society, including in the educational department, managing data can be crucial in the field like education, smart classrooms have been developed into expanding the database of resources, Digital systems can record every individual performance and can provide and accurate customized report of the specifics need, With classroom strength increasing day by day this kind of technology will help be the breakthrough in education, this will ease the burden on both teachers and students, not just in the future but even in todays daily life, this does not mean teacherless classrooms as no computer nor robot can fulfill the multiple roles that teachers play, however, some of the tasks can be automated through machine learning.</p>

<p>Another way machine learning has impacted society is in our smart home and home security, using set algorithms integrated from machine learning into alarm systems and surveillance cameras a lot of the smart security has become very popular today, ML uses facial recognition technology to build a catalog of frequent visitors at home and recognizes unusual visitors, It can tell the working parents when kids get home and can even call for emergency services, this provides a more safer and easier experience to people with smart security then your regular “home” security.</p>

<p>Automation of our domestic life is already happening, digital assistants like Amazon Echo and Alexa allow for voice activated control of our smart home (by dimming lights, locking the door, even to setting an alarm right at our command).</p>



<p>How will this affect your family or you?</p>

<p>In all honesty, I hope for the Future of ML(machine learning) one of my reasons is because when my mum was 26 she lost her license because she started to lose her vison, my mum misses driving and I would give anything to see my mother smile again and give her the ability to do the things she misses to do, so if we had things like automated cars she would be able to drive again and you wouldn’t really need a license then, with automated apps that can pick the best route for a blind person with the lease amount of traffic you ensure the safety of travel for people who can’t see, as a career to a blind person I see the benefits in machine learning</p>

<p>The benefits for me is the ability to work with programs that can look over certain algorithms and assist me in mistakes that I make, theirs the possibility of them unlocking interstellar space travel which would be a massive benefit to me and to society as I would love to venture out into the vas space and explore other planets, but for that we would need machines to map and plot courses using complex algorithms that can detect any anomaly (blackhole, wormhole, supernova etc.) another way this would also assist me is in the work force, a lot of jobs are evolving to the technical era and for that the life of the “worker” becomes more easier, to be able to analyze the creation of another person’s work in AI would give me the ability to create or improve my own program, this is a life experience that a lot of people would never get which would give me a better understanding of Machine Learning as we evolve more towards a full board technical era, paving away for tasks to become easier.</p>

<p><b><h3 id="KungpengXU">Cloud services</h3></b></p>

<p>Author:Kungpeng Xu</p>




<p>What does it do?</p>



<p>Cloud services are Internet-based modes of augmentation, usage, and interaction of related services, they are involving the provision of dynamically scalable and often virtualized resources over the Internet. Cloud is a metaphor for the network and the Internet. In the past, the cloud was often used to represent the telecommunication network in the diagram, it was also used to represent the abstraction of the Internet and the underlying infrastructure. Cloud services also obtaining the required services in an on-demand and easily expand through the network. Cloud services can be IT software, Internet-related, or other services. It means that computing power can also be circulated as a commodity over the Internet.</p>

<p>By accessing on-demand processing capabilities, highly scalable platform and more flexible IT technologies, Cloud computing has become a new technology in 2022.</p>

<p>There are 7 main things can be easily done by Cloud services:</p>



<p>Website application: Individuals can use cloud servers to deploy personal blog systems and forum systems, and can also create a cool website according to their own ideas, publish articles, pictures, videos, etc.</p>

<p>Enterprises are mainly it for website construction, and they are suitable for various applications such as community websites, corporate official websites, portal websites, e-commerce websites, and games.</p>

<p>Cloud server rental is characterized by its low price, high quality and flexible operation, so these small and medium-sized enterprises can obtain suitable cloud servers from cloud service providers with low cost, thereby establishing their own e-commerce and online trading platforms.</p>



<p>Office system application: Computer office is very popular, and office software has become a basic software application that enterprises must have. Deploying office software such as OA, ERP, CRM, and enterprise mailboxes on cloud servers is believed to be used by most office workers . The deployment of these office software on cloud servers is roughly the same.</p>



<p>Database application: As the increasing of application in the IT industry, a lot of enterprises use cloud servers as separate database application servers, and they use cloud servers to install database services. The cloud server is paired with object storage, and the object storage is used as the storage of static pictures, videos, and download packages to reduce storage costs.</p>



<p>Comprehensive protection: The cloud server provides basic protection functions such as Trojan horse detection, brute force cracking protection, and vulnerability scanning, and provides DDoS protection against various high-traffic attacks such as Syn Flood and ICMP Flood.</p>





<p>Reliable: As the service is distributed on multiple servers or even multiple computer rooms, it is not easy to completely shut down, and the disaster resistance and fault tolerance ability is strong, which can ensure long-term online. If one server fails, other servers will take its place.</p>



<p>Good scalability: The basic feature of cloud hosting is the distributed architecture, so it is easy to add servers and multiply service capabilities.</p>



<p>Save costs: As services can be distributed across multiple servers, resources can be fully utilized, not only reducing hardware, power, and maintenance costs, but also automatically increasing capacity to meet demand when there is more demand on the server without permanent payments.</p>



<p>There are few things are likely to be done within 3years:</p>



<p>As the interaction between the cloud and the enterprise, people are developing more capabilities and ideas for cloud capabilities. Due to the lack of some ideas, we have been using the public cloud. But for many enterprises, they prefer to choose private cloud to have better control over their internal processes. Even though there were not be much growth in private cloud in 2020, people is getting more knowledge of private cloud, the users will increase in the next three years. The cloud teleology is becoming democratize.</p>



<p>Cloud computing and artificial intelligence are closely related. Artificial intelligence provides a lot of help for cloud computing, such as managing data and optimizing workflow. Cloud computing also increases the reach of artificial intelligence. The global market for artificial intelligence is expected to be worth $89 billion by 2025, meaning some organizations that don’t embrace the technology will be left behind. Cloud services are influencing AI to become democratize technology, they are making it accessible, even the small organizations can use it as well. Generally, buying artificial intelligence requires a lot of capital and computer skills. As artificial intelligence is provided by cloud services, companies can use this technology with significant less investment.</p>



<p>What is the likely impact?</p>



<p>Impact on business：The cloud data centers expected to handle 94 percent of business work by 2021, this transition is affecting all areas of business, from frontline workers to senior management and everyone in between. The key impacts cloud computing will have on businesses in the near future include: improved communication, safe collaboration and optimize customer experience.</p>



<p>Impact on employees: The backbone of every business is its employees. The economists have been predicting the impact of automation, it is certain that employees will still play a key role in future business. For technologists, using the cloud solutions can help employees to decrease their working pressure. Therefore, the IT professionals are able to focus on key business goals without spending too much time on tedious tasks. Cloud technology enables all employees to work on other devices, such as iPad and smartphones, without worrying about losing data. This flexible workflow is especially useful, working from home is becoming normal. The adoption of cloud-based video conferencing and remote collaboration has increased in recent years. Cloud computing will become even more important. As using cloud computing can enjoy many benefits that have the potential to increase employee satisfaction in the workplace. This frees workers to be creative while helping employers reduce turnover.</p>

<p>However, employee’s attitudes and productivity can create or break a company's future. While cloud computing was not developed to improve employee mood, it offers some advantages that benefit employees.</p>



<p>Impact on society: People can live, work and play by taking advantage of the advances in computer technology. As remote work gains widespread acceptance, more people are expected to transit into this lifestyle. Improvements in 5G, cloud computing and electronics manufacturing are likely to combine. In the future, each item may contain high level of computing power. If it implemented, this paradigm will provide to users with many possibilities.</p>



<p>How will this affect you?</p>



<p>From my perspective,cloud service has improved my quality of life. Since I'm still a student, there may not be enough places to use cloud services. But during the study, we will save some assignment and data to the cloud server, so that we can download our assignment anytime and anywhere, which is also helpful for me and my classmates to discuss assignment problems at any time. With the current learning method, the most of my courses are online teaching, so most of the learning materials are come from the content that shared by the teacher on the cloud server. In terms of entertainment, I can save my favorite games to the cloud server, so that I can play my favorite games on different devices.</p>

<p>Another very handy feature of a cloud server is: it can store a lot of photos. My parents really like this feature, because they like to store a lot of old photos. Before the cloud service created, we would lose a lot of photos due to loss of mobile phones or damage to memory cards. Now we can store photos on the cloud server and download them anytime.</p>

<p>The development of cloud services is also an opportunity for me, because I am currently studying a major that is related to information technology. In the future, the society will need more professional IT workers to develop cloud services, which would gain more work opportunities for me in the future.</p>

 <p><b><h3 id="Lachlan">Cybersecurity</h3></b></p>

 <p>Author:Lachlan Cottrell</p>


<p>What does it do?</p>



<p>Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems that companies and individuals use on an every-day basis. Hardware, software and data is protected from malicious access by unauthorised individuals through cybersecurity.</p>

<p>New technology developing in the field of cyber security is now more personal than ever before as many organisations and businesses have employees working from home. Usually, companies have better security then we have in our own homes. Now that we are not always under this protection, there’s a new opportunity for those wishing to maliciously access our data. Recent developments in the cybersecurity industry help protect our information on our personal computers.</p>

<p>User Behaviour Analytics (UBA) is not a new technology, being first released in the early 2000s. However, it is now more relevant and rigorous then before.  UBA now utilises advancements in deep learning and artificial intelligence to analyse how we use our computer, what applications we open and what websites we look at. When these habits are out of line and in conjunction with a breach this allows our systems to quickly red flag these actions and protect us accordingly.</p>

<p>Advancements in Artificial Intelligence have not only helped to recognise when an attack is happening as with UBA, but also in prediction of attacks. Since tradition security software cannot process the vast range of new malware being created, new AI systems are battling this. These AI systems use sophisticated algorithms to detect malware, unusual patterns before the attacks can happen. AI allows for a predictive intelligence which considers recent news and studies of cyber threats, better preparing your security system to an attack that may happen (Belani, 2022).</p>

<p>Embedded Hardware Authentication is another recent authentication tool developed by Intel and integrated into their new sixth-generation vPro Chips. Instead of a username and password being required to access a system, a token is required also to add a third layer of authentication. In this case the token is embedded within the hardware to ensure the person accessing your data is you. These authentication chips embedded into hardware are designed to revolutionise the way authentication works on everyday machines.</p>



<p>In the future, Artificial Intelligence is set to be a core component of Cybersecurity. AI also inherently creates cybersecurity risks as potential exploits, as this is technology that is developing (Parker, 2022).  This will require Cybersecurity software and the industry to evolve to combat this, perhaps through the advancements in AI to help protect its own flaws or by simulating network attacks to better understand them.</p>

<p>Another element in the future of Cybersecurity is the prevalence of Cyberwarfare. Cyberwarfare is becoming a common occurrence, a way of less established countries being able to embed viruses or access information from another nation. This will create challenges for the Cybersecurity industry. How to protect data and systems with technology that is constantly improving is a never-ending battle. In the future, it will require constant advancements as not to fall behind.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity has been made possible by advancements in the I.T world, but also been made a necessity. With 86% of Australian households having access to a personal computer in 2017 (Household use of information technology, 2016-17 financial year, 2022) and 75.8% of Australians having access to a mobile phone in 2017 (Australia: smartphone penetration rate 2017-2025 | Statista, 2022), the need for cybersecurity becomes obvious. Online banking and personal conversations that need protection require cybersecurity influences to allow privacy and safety. Advancements in blockchain have been important to the world of cybersecurity, allowing secure sharing of information and identity authentication. Applications In general are now more secure than earlier versions, as companies take action to protect themselves and their customers.</p>


<p>What is the likely impact?</p>

<p>Cybersecurity will not impact the everyday user, as much as it will enable them to do the things that are doing currently more safely. It may require them to download a security program or implement a measure to keep their data safe. Although this inconvenience is minute compared to the effect these security measures will have on protecting them. People use online technology regularly and it is a necessity to live the way we do currently.  The advancements in security allow them to do so with more control over who has access to their data.</p>

<p>However, it does impact the way businesses and companies must protect themselves to prevent an attack or breach. Cybersecurity is more important in any field then ever before as online attacks become more prevalent. This changes the way the commercial world secures their information. It’s different to psychical protection, as in locking a door or window. It’s a new form of security that is alien to a lot of people, although inevitably required as the world is online and is going to stay that way.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity has created a whole range of different jobs, with 3.5 million job openings predicted for 2025. Despite the efforts of the industry to reduce the skills gap, the worlds open cybersecurity positions in 2021 is enough to fill 50 NFL stadiums. (Morgan, 2022). There’s a huge demand for individuals with cybersecurity certifications. Microsoft, IBM and Google have all pledged to train individuals to help reduce this shortage (Morgan, 2022). Cybersecurity has created a plethora of different opportunities for individuals with the right qualifications. As cybersecurity hasn’t replaced an existing industry or format, it hasn’t made other industries redundant. Cybersecurity has only expanded the options for individuals with the right experience.</p>


<p>How will this affect you?</p>

<p>Cybersecurity affects everyone with access to the internet, whether they realise it or not. Everything we do online is somehow related to cybersecurity. Whether it be accidently clicking an email with malicious malware embedded or entering bank details into a website that looks legitimate but isn’t. Everyone is affected in some way by Cybersecurity and having a basic knowledge of steps you can take to protect yourself are essential in our lives.</p>

<p>For me, Cybersecurity is something that I try to keep at the forefront of my mind when using the internet. Scam emails and messages on social media are regular occurrences and having antimalware software on my computer is something I see as a necessity.</p>

<p>For my family and friends, especially older family educating them on the basics of cybersecurity has been something I’ve tried to do. My grandmother regularly calls me with questions about suspicious emails she receives or the pop-ups on websites that she accidently clicks on. She is now mindful of these and has also installed anti malware software. I believe that cybersecurity has affected her in a positive way, allowing her to browse the internet with an awareness that there is malicious activity out there and there’s steps you can take to prevent unwanted obtrusion.</p><br><br>

<p>Imagine, having control over your own baking in a sense that you run your own bank.</p>

<p>That means: you don’t have to ask for permission for any bank transactions, access or moving money, you don’t have to pay any bank fees or have any connection to a third party for your own banking.</p>

<p>Blokchain technology, still mysterious for public understanding but well present, allows us to have all mentioned above.

Blockchain could be called a history of transactions that exists on network.

Blockchain was first applied to criptocurrency with appereance of Bitcoin.

Cryptocurrencies, use blockchain to operate or in the other words Blockchain technology allows criptocurrency to exist.

Transfer of cryptocurrency is peer to peer which means that there is no need for one central server.

All the data is scattered everywhere on the internet and is independent form each other or anyone.

Benefits of this is huge.Acces can be gained anytime from anywhere in the world.

Security, access and safety is way better maintained than in case of centralized server.</p>

<p>If in any case one peer is not working there is other peers, which means there is practically no way for the system to fail like in the case of centralized server.Network doesn’t depend on one person or organization so there is no way of fail in that sense too.</p>

<p>In terms of dynamics and navigation it works in a way where every change is embedded in blockchain with its own key and every future change takes that key within itself and carry it to a further change. Mentioned above means once established there is no way to change anything within history blockcahins. That makes it absolutely independent in terms of security, safety and accessibility.</p>

<p>Being able to do transactions without someone in between especially in banking is state of the art  idea and that is possible through blockhain technology.</p>

<p>Security levels are high and this makes the whole idea even more mesmerizing.</p>

<p>Blockchain evolution started with 1.0 where it was used to store and transfer the value (Beginning of Bitcoin) While in next generation 2.0 it received programmable environment through smart contracts.( Ethereum)

In 3.0 incarnation it reaches the everyday life because of its application form and its applied everywhere form healthcare, education, agriculture, e-commerce and many more.

Blockchain 4.0, it utilizes a distributed environment suffering from major issues like scalability and limited transaction per second.It basically fixs all the missed parts on previous versions.

The future of this concept is bright since the business  industries are starting to adjust their business models to this upcoming and rising technology.

Many private enterprises, governments, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are already using blockchain to effect social impact.

Some of the companies using blockchain to deliver information for their customers from the very beginning of their production chain.Example is in food industry: where is traceable, everything from what pesticides are used all the way what package was used with all environmental policies.

Another example of application could be: Government spending could be traceable and transparent, as would financial transactions for everything from paying taxes to taxes on profits.

Looking at healthcare, your medical records and treatments could be safely stored and instantly available to doctors in case of emergency.</p>

<p>Centralized banking systems of today could be changed to blockchain decentralized systems which have accessibility as a critical and the best asset of block chain, way better sorted than in traditional banking. In this case criptocurrencies could be used for easier and quicker transactions between customers around the globe.

Blockchain has great potential to revolutionize our relationship with energy too.

There are a multitude of blockchain technology-based programs fighting to save the planet from climate change.

Terrapass Coins are digital coins that give people control over carbon offsets. Each coin is equivalent to avoiding more than 2,500 miles of driving.</p> 



<p>Its visible from the above that Blockchain has disrupted currency through Bitcoin, and is now disrupting various industries by bringing in a new form of ‘digital trust’.



Blockchain and criptocurrency use in everyday life will have huge impact on our lives in near future.

The feature called smart contract will allow us to program contract up front and then once all the criteria is met from both sides the funds would be released. This great thing takes out all the fraud and security risks and allows parties to do all the transactions without banks and any centralized server.

This doesn’t just include online payments and contracts, but also in-store purchases, public transportation and other areas where we will use crypto currency very soon. </p>
