			   <p>I came to Australia 17 years ago in 2005.</p>
			   <p>I came from former Yugoslav republic and now country Bosnia and Herzegovina. My nationality is Serbian and culture could be closely described as Orthodox, Slavic, Eastern European culture.My big passion is music.My experience with IT did not involve actual programing as I did more computer maintenance and customized hardware assembly for my personal purposes.</p>

         <h3>Group Processes:</h3>
         <p>Completion of Assignment 2 was great learning curve for me.</p>
         <p>Overall I'm extremely happy with how it all went and with the final grades. Considering time limits and enviroment, where people are cooperating on team project on a topic that is new for them I personally think that we have done a solid job. As with everything, there is room for improvement. In this Assignement we will approach the subject in a way that's tailored to the individual members since we know each other better now. </p>
         <br><br>

         <h3>Career Plans:</h3>
         <p><i><b>Common elements:</b></i><p>
         <p>Members of the A Team have first common mark in wanting to extend their knowledge in field of IT.</p>
         <p>Ideal jobs span from being a software developer in different fileds, games developer, to a network analyst. Common elements here apart from generic skills are some niche skills that are required:good knowledge of Operating Systems,Data structures,Cloud services.</p>
       <p>To be able to find a job in their desired fields all member of the A Team will have to gain solid knowledge in coding,software framevorks,cryptography,source control and testing procedures.</p>

         <p><i><b>Differences:</b></i></p>

         <p>Three members all have an interest in: game developement and software developement. These both have pretty similar requirement in terms of perticular IT skills required to get their ideal jobs. That's Lachalan as game developer,Kungpeng as software developer and Dario as an Audio Application Software Developer. There is a little bit of difference when it's compared to Aaron ideal job as an Network Analyst where some other skills are needed such as:network infrastructure, network security and Access Points. </p>

         <p><i><b>How similar and different are career plans across the group:</b></i></p>

         <p>Appart from must having the generic skills like working in teams,good comunication skills,solving problems, similarities: especially between three connected to software developementare almost 100%. After gained knowledge and experience even demand from employers are similar. Network analyst job requires as mentioned above, a little bit different set of perticular IT skills and thats the main difference. Exeperience wise and in terms of demand this job title is most sought after in the field of IT when compared with previous three.

         <p>I was born in regional Victoria, growing up in the town of Mildura.</p>
         <p>I have lived here most of my life, I have 12 cousins which I grew up with here. My whole family lives in the Mildura region. I completed Year 12 at Coomealla High School in 2012, I then worked on farms up until 2020 when I started an apprenticeship as a Diesel Mechanic. I am the third generation of farmers in my family, with my grandfather being a pioneer in table grape export industry in the 80’s. My father and his two brothers are still farming locally today. One of my favourite past times is Golf, Mildura is a golfers dream with access to 6 courses in the area. </p><br><br>


         <h3>Group Processes:</h3>
         <p>The A-Team primarily communicated through Microsoft Teams. We organised two meetings per week on average</p>
         <p> We would arrange the first meeting time, and then organise our second meeting for that week on conclusion of the first meeting. We always had our meetings via MS-Teams as our group members are spread right across Australia. In the rare situation we had a group member not responding, we continued as planned and recorded the meeting so that the missing member could rewatch the recording. This way we didn’t fall behind, and always had the information available via the recording.</p>
         <p> We worked as a team to ensure even if someone was unable to make it, we continued and had constant progress on our assignment.</p>
         <br><br>

         <h3>Career Plans:</h3>
<p><i><b>Common elements:</b></i><p>
<p>Two of our four members have an interest in software related fields. Audio application software development and software engineering both involve the development of software, just for different applications. It appears the industry wide shortage of software professionals makes this field of IT very appealing. This seems a common theme across all the group’s ideal jobs, a role that is wanted by employers.</p>

<p><i><b>Differences:</b></i></p>

<p>Dario’s ideal job as an Audio application software developer is unique in the fact that is primarily dealing with audio. Aarons is also unique as it would be analysing networks and improving them. Out of our group he is the only one interested in this field, and the only member not ideally ending up in program development. Kunpeng has the broadest ideal job as a software engineer could work in any field or design applications for a wide range of uses. I am the only member of our team to seek a role that is more team and leadership based.</p>

<p><i><b>How similar and different are career plans across the group:</b></i></p>

<p>Overall, our group is relatively similar. With a majority being interested in the development of software. The application in which the software would be used is where the differences are:
games, audio and general software development cover a wide range of different jobs and fields. They are all well paid and are in demand by employers, there’s usually a shortage in the field and that makes jobs more desirable as it’s very likely to be employed.</p>

         <p>I am from China and this is my seventh year in Australia</p> <p>I have been living in Adelaide for the past seven years. I choose to live in this country when I was 17 because Australia has less stress. </p>
         <p>In 2018 I graduated from Adelaide High School, and I also learned a lot about local cultures, but I still use Chinese to talk to my family at home .I am an optimistic person .In my free time, I tend to gather my friends to play various games or chat together. </p>
         <p> I often go to the gym to let my body get more fitness ,as I’m also a basketball player.</p><br><br>

         <h3>Group Processes:</h3>
         <p>From the assignment 2, our group members were very efficient in completing the task, and everyone was respect to each other. And we finally completed assignment 2 perfectly.</p>
         <p> Due to the absence of a group member, we decided to change our project idea, because the project idea we decided on assignment 2 came from that team member who absent the meeting frequently. As he missed out an important meeting, we can not ask him for the further information about his project idea. But this will not affect our subsequent procedures and progress, because we fixed our plan and new project idea for the assignment 3 in the short time. Then we can quickly execute the plan.</p>
         <br><br>

         <h3>Career Plans:</h3>
         <p>Through the feedback from previous Assignments, as well as the understanding of each team member’s ideal job, I concluded that our career planning has a common point, which is we all need to be able to use basic code applications, such as Python and Java.</p>
         <p> However, the trend point of each occupation may be different.</p>
         <p> For example, Aaron's ideal career is network analysis, he may focus on coding software such as CSS and Java, but Lachlan's ideal career is a game programme, he will be exposed to more programming software, but some like Java software will be less exposed for him.</p>

          <p>I’m 22 Born in Australia, I’m currently studying at RMIT University</p>
          <p>Last forum of education I had was a Diploma of interactive media and Game Design in 2018 before working for my brother-in-law for his company Wafflesoft, where we started the design on the project “Outback Survival”. </p>
          <p>I moved my interests away from game design and closer towards AI Design, though I wouldn’t be able to communicate with other AI scientists around the world as I can only speak one language Fluently despite going around the world, I would probably need an Interpreter Ha-ha.</p>
          <br><br>


          <h3>Group Processes:</h3>
          <br>
          <p>After Completing assignment 3, I feel that most, if not all of us put in a lot of time to perfect this, and a lot of effort</p>
          <p>Especially with 2-3 members in the group taking on 2 Courses at the same time and the increasing difficulty with having weekly assignments from the Intro to programming</p>
          <p>I have had times where I was extremely sick and have been having technical difficulties with google and my computer for some of the duration of Assignment 2 and 3 which made completing a lot of tasks given to me and making meeting times on time difficult as I don’t use a laptop.</p>
          <p>Despite this I believe we have done the best we can and will go forth with flying colors.Originally, I didn’t think we would be able to make it given that a group of complete strangers who have probably been out of school for a few years now got thrown into a group knowing little to nothing about each other.</p>
        <p>But our group leader Dario who played an Important part to the Group in the Role he took on that was made as a group choice given his experience in the workplace, he was able to clearly summarize tasks and needed things as well as being a major assistant in the HTML side of things.</p>
        <p>Dario’s assistance made completing each assignment easier with his ability to make a clear picture in what we have to do even for a visual learner, which is a very efficient way to choose our roles given experience.</p>
        <p>I wasn’t able to show up on time to a lot of things the group was able to complete a lot of task, though this should improve in the future with our next upcoming tasks</p>
          <br>

          <h3>Career Plans:</h3><br>
<p>Kevin:</p>
