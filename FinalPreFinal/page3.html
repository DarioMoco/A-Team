     <h1 style="font-family:Baskerville Old Face; "><em>Overview of Project Idea:</em></h1>
     <h3 style="font-family:Baskerville Old Face; "><em>Application "Mechanics Friend" </em></h3>


<p>After completing Assignment 1 and Assignment2, our group has a rough project plan. Our project of choice is ‘Mechanic's Friend’.
  <p>As smartphones are now widely used, the demand for mobile phone applications is also increasing. This project has good potential in IT industry. By completing Assignment 2, the group members all got to know each other, and we all had a lot of passion for the finalized project idea. Everyone is actively discussing how to make this project work in real life.</p>


      <p>When making a plan,we arranged the steps through, in accordance to the skills of each team member.</p>
      <p>For example, Dario has very good web production skills, he can spend most of his time on web production, Aaron has a very good summary ability, he can classify and summarise all the collected information. Lachlan, as the main creator of this project, he will explain more details of the project to give us a better understanding of the project. Kunpeng has good research skills and he can get useful information from many sources.</p>
      <p> By reading the feedback from Assignment 1 and Assignment 2, we understand that our project idea needs further investigation and research. This is the main goal for Assignment 3. Especially the limitations and scope of the project. These should be improved and focused on in Assignment 3.</p>
      <p>This project idea may have the similar applications,we have to show that our project is unique, which is also our focus on in Assignment 3.</p>

      <p>By completing this project, we will improve our design thinking skills and planning skills. It allows us to learn how to successfully create a new products within a specified time, let it continue to develop, then achieve the Final goal.</p><br>

      <h2>Topic,Motivation,Landscape</h2>
      <br>

       <h2>Topic:</h2><br>

       <p>The main aim of our project here in Assignment 3 is to develop the propper starting point for amazing idea of "Mechanics Friend" application.</p>
       <p>This application will not just serve Automotive Industry workers and businesses but the customers also. Customers will have the proof and history of what's been done on their car, and workers will have a history of their committed works.</p>
       <p>The planning and all needed steps should be main focus of this project since we don't currently have the capabilities to do the actual programming. After the project is done, all needed details are included so the framework to creating Mechanics Friend is established.</p><br>
      <br>
     </p>


     <p>
       <h2>Motivation:</h2><br>

       <p>Motivation for this project apart from a great idea itself, is the fact that is possible to deliver great ideas into reality by proper team work. That is exciting because we are at the beginning of our journey in this field. It helps to establish experience for all the future similar projects.</p>
       <p>As mentioned above, the idea itself makes this project even more exciting. This idea is great and we as a team are convinced that it could have a great future if developed and delivered properly.</p>
       <p>Mechanics friend benefits all parties involved, with an emphasis on the costumer.</p>

       <p>Through the experience of Lachlan, the creator of the idea; we learned that he was amazed how little power the customers had if there was an issue after works had been completed on their vehicle. This was especially true if the customer had very little mechanical knowledge. These individuals were very vulnerable to excessive charges for unnecessary work done</p>

       <p>This is an important project because we believe there’s an issue with the way smaller automotive businesses operate with internal time management and efficient task delegation. There’s also an issue for customers, it’s very rare they are present for the completion of the work they paid for. It’s also rare that they have a firm understanding of what happened. This project is designed to not only increase the efficiency of the work being done, but also to inform and give a greater understanding to the individual paying for it.</p>

       <p>Compared to current IT trends, this application isn’t defining any new or ground-breaking technology. It’s simply harnessing the currently available technology to solve a problem in a simple fashion. Smart phones and computers are very accessible and allow an application like this to be easily integrated into a business.  </p>

       <p>If we were able to work on this project, this would show a future employer efficient problem solving and a motivation to help people.</p>
</p>
 <p>
       <h2>Landscape:</h2><br>
    <p>There are similar management applications available that are comparable to Mechanics Friend. In terms of time tracking or task tracking and scheduling, they could be called similar but none of them do exactly what our application is doing.</p>
    <p>The most similar one is "Mymobileworkers" but again that application is for wider use and it's not exactly the same as our idea.</p>
    <p>Software such as Fullbay, ShopMonkey, and Workshopsoftware all offer similar features. They are also very expensive:</p>
    <p>Shop Monkey – USD $125/month</p>
    <p>Workshopsoftware – Bronze package at USD $50/month</p>
    <p>Fullbay – doesn’t openly advertise pricing without organising a quote.</p>
    <p>These three options all include invoicing systems, payment options, inventory, reports and even customer communication options. We believe a lot of automotive workplaces aren’t looking for such in-depth and intrusive “one stop shop” solutions. Mechanics Friend offers cheap and simple management solutions without having to completely shuffle the way the business is run. They also do not offer the receipts with information for customers as Mechanics Friend does.</p><br>
