		<h2 class="intro">Summary of skills needed for the next step in developement:</h2>


<p>Apart from roles of The A Team Members described in previous chapter our team will eventually become bigger and it will be consisted of addition of Software developers.</p>
<p><i>Software developers</i> as they are called by one unifying name can be divided into <i>front-end</i> and <i>back-end</i> developers.</p>
<p> Their job is to create the final product and test it by coding in different programming languages.</p>
<p> Difference is that front-end crew is working on everything visible by users and the last are the ones behind all the infrastructure and nuances,like looks of individual parts embeded in application and inventory.</p>
<p> One of the most important aspect in developement is connection between UI/UE designers with developers because that connection will produce the final form of application. Also important is that connection is good with Bussines Analyst and Developers because this is how the demographic and structural form of application will be created.</p>
<p> Within the developement team also there is roles like <i>team lead</i> and <i>tech lead</i> where team lead is the person in charge of motivation and organization of determined actions to be done. They make sure that everything functioning as it should within their own team.Tech lead is a person which taked care of hardware and technical aspect needed for team of developers to achieve their goals.</p>
<p> There is a role of <i>Scrum Master</i> and that role involves just making sure that the spirits of the team are on proper levels and that all the frameworks taken are not the one which are the obstacle in productive and creative process. It's a role of a Team Leader acctually but without executable authority over the team members.</p>

<p><b>Development Team Roles and Titles</b></p>

<p><i>Lead Developer:</i></p>
<p>Software development is a specialized field that involves a complex set of systems and processes. For businesses diving into the digital trends, their development team must be adept in the latest technology. However, building a solid development team can be challenging. Even more so if you are a non-technical founder. But this is where the lead developer comes in.</p>
<p>A lead developer oversees giving technical direction and mentoring to a group of software engineers. This position is sometimes referred to as development lead, technical lead, lead programmer, or lead application developer.</p>
<p>A lead developer ought to be able to prioritize, recommend the best tools or methods, and differentiate between user needs and optional desires. Being able to handle challenges positively and deal with stressful situations calmly and confidently will mean that you stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>So often in business, soft skills are crucial â€“ especially when talking to clients, user researchers, and managers. A lead developer ought to be able to prioritize, recommend the best tools or methods, and differentiate between user needs and optional desires. </p>
<p><i>Technical Designer:</i></p>
<p>Technical designers draft a final design in a software system including AutoCAD and coordinate with manufacturers and vendors to produce the design. When a final product is delivered, technical designers review and inspect it for quality. They measure garments and accessories to align with specifications, attend product fittings, and collaborate with vendors. They identify potential problems with products and follow through to ensure concerns or flaws are resolved as scheduled. They must travel both domestically and internationally to meet with manufacturers, designs, and vendors. Technical designers need a bachelor's degree in fashion or related fields.</p>
<p>A Technical Designers act as an important bridge connecting design and programming in game development.</p>
<p>They act as a mediator between these two principles and solve any technical issues within the software, tools and systems. Their role is to anticipate, identify and remove any obstacles to allow the design team to focus on their work.</p>
<p>To take on this role, you will need to be an innovative problem solver, know how to prototype and have excellent communication skills to allow you to collaborate with others. Understanding of game design and experience in programming is essential.</p>


<p><i>Application Designer:</i></p>

<p>An app developer is a computer software engineer whose primary responsibilities include creating, testing and programming apps for computers, mobile phones, and tablets. These developers typically work in teams and think of ideas and concepts either for the general public, or for a specific customer need.</p>
<p>App developers understand coding languages and how to use them, and may also work alongside graphic artists, data scientists, and other software experts to create applications. They also test and fix any bugs that are found before the product is launched.</p>
<p>An application developer's typical responsibilities include coding, designing, application management, troubleshooting, monitoring updates and possible security threats, and providing end user support. They may also handle some project management tasks on the journey to building a new application.</p>
