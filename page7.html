<h4><p>Dario Moconja</p></h4>
<p>In this chapter of the course we continued to establish and embrace good and positive from Assignment 2. This made me personally have more motivation to finish this Assignment the best possible way. All team  members, I think, gave their best performance in accordance with their abilities and time, and life commitments.</p>
<h4><p>Lachlan Cottrell</p></h4>
<p>Our group was a positive experience for me, from the beginning we fostered a positive environment that we could all strive to do the best we could on our assignments. This was our strongest point, there was no point in which we bickered amongst ourselves.</p>
<h4><p>Kunpeng XU</p></h4>
<p>After completing assignment 3, I feel that each of us put in a lot of time to perfect this assignment, as we want to get a better grade than Assignment 2. Due to the importance of this assignment, we planned it well in advance.</p>
<p>Even though we revised the project idea from  the beginning, but it did not affect our main goal. Everyone in the team makes plans and implements them quickly, and can identify and solve problems in the shortest time.</p>
<h4><p>Aaron Moyle</p></h4>
<p>After Completing Assignment 3, I feel that most if not all of us put in a lot of time to perfect this and a lot of effort, especially with 2-3 members in the group taking on 2 Courses at the same time and the increasing difficulty with having weekly assignments from the Intro to programming.I have had times where I was extremely sick and have been having technical difficulties with google and my computer for some of the duration of Assignment 2 and 3 which made completing a lot of tasks given to me and making meeting times on time difficult as I don’t use a laptop. Despite this I believe we have done the best we can and will go forth with flying colors.</p>

<h4><p>Dario Moconja</p></h4>
<p>The way of communication has to have more options then Microsoft Teams. This limits the students to access the communication tool in just one particular way. I don’t want to go into nuances what all can “go wrong” but this way is limiting just because not all the people have the same resources.</p>
<p> Assignment as a team work depends on individuals creating the team and sometimes this is hard to manage. If some issues come along, regardless of what type,and that fact cause: the whole team members suffer in terms of grades or any further destruction from main goal: which is education  and learning,than we can not have a clear picture of learning curve and profile of an individual.This is related especially for Assignments which carry big percentage of course body.</p>
<h4><p>Lachlan Cottrell</p></h4>
<p>We could’ve improved on the ways in which we communicated; Microsoft teams means sometimes group members are uncontactable as they may not have it installed on their phone. We could’ve set up another means of communication purely to setup and organise meetings.</p>
<h4><p>Kunpeng XU</p></h4>
<p>There are some factors that cause some decisions not to be completed on time. It's because someone didn't show up on time, but they had a valid reason for their absence.</p>
<h4><p>Aaron Moyle</p></h4>
<p>I wasn’t able to show up on time to a lot of things. The group was able to complete a lot of task, though this should improve in the future with our next upcoming tasks.</p>

<p><b><h3 id="Surprise">At least one thing that was surprising:</h3></b></p>
<h4><p>Dario Moconja</p></h4>
<p>Surprising thing was a fact that in my own way I understood the power of Team in an absolutely new environment and field where people are not really experts. This showed me that stuff can be created without too much worries about the personnel individually but about trying to understand the substance the best possible way and light the subject partially until the whole revealed.
<h4><p>Lachlan Cottrell</p></h4>
<p>I was surprised at how well this process went. We worked together well, enjoyed each other’s company and overall fostered a positive learning environment. This is a rarity amongst group assignments which are renowned for being a bit of a headache.</p>
<h4><p>Kunpeng XU</p></h4>
<p>In the meeting, the group members carefully analyze the subjects and make a decision together, which is a very efficient way to choose their strong parts to complete.</p>
<h4><p>Aaron Moyle</p></h4>
<p>Originally I didn’t think we would be able to make it, given that a group of complete strangers who have probably been out of school for a few years now got thrown into a group knowing little to nothing about each other. But our group leader Dario who played an Important part to the Group in the Role he took on that was made as a group choice given his experience in the workplace, he was able to clearly Summarize tasks and Needed things as well as being a major assistant in the HTML side of things.With Dario’s assistance he made completing each assignment easier with his ability to make a clear picture in what we have to do even for a visual learner which is a very efficient way to choose our roles given experience.</p>

<p><b><h3 id="Group">At least one thing that you have learned about groups:</h3></b></p>
<h4><p>Dario Moconja</p></h4>
<p>Groups are consisted by individuals but are creation of separate entity than individuals. This means that every individual in the group has to be assigned the task best possible suited for that individual and then the benefit for the group will be great. If that part of group construction is not sorted well group as an entity will work at limited power.
<h4><p>Lachlan Cottrell</p></h4>
<p>I've learnt that not all groups are bad, and there’s positive experiences to be had.</p>
