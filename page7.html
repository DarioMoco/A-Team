	 <p>IT Project Idea.<p>Author: Aaron Moyle</p>
 </p><br>

<p>My IT project Idea is to create a smartphone APP that connects the Disabled to a local support worker using a profiling database that uses certain algorithms and profiling questions to link the user to a disability support worker that best suites what they’re looking for.</p>

<p>Like most dating apps this will use a similar profiling system that they use but setup/recoded in a way that instead of swiping left and right from both the Disabled user and the Disability support worker, the Disabled user will swipe on the best matches that show up on his/her Match side, when the user swipes on a Disability worker the worker will get a notification(this can either by via text or an in app notification) and will let the Worker know that they have been selected by a Disabled user, they can then from there link their plan they have so they can hire the Disability support worker but instead of them getting their full amount for an hour if they only do half an hours work, they will use a two way logging system where it checks if the disability worker has logged the same amount of hours as what the Disabled user has logged in for the worker.</p>
<p> This algorithm is to check for scammers amongst the Workers to make sure both User and worker get a more User friendly experience and don’t think they’re being exploited, this allows the Disabled user to not lose money on his/her plan and allows the Support worker to be paid the proper amount for the work they have performed.</p>
<p> Though this can be used for a Regular day to day basis my intentions for the Project idea is mainly in case of an emergency situation.</p>
<p>Currently I do not know the programs I would need to create a program of this complexity as I’m yet to learn how to create my own applications and which programs are best to use when creating such applications, though I do believe the code I will need to use is Python integrated with the C language and to test out this program in a white box(Test dummy) application where I can code the program from the ground up to watch its creation, one of these programs that I know of android studio which I could probably use to bring my idea’s to fruition.</p>
<p>The reason I would like to create this application is because my mother is Vision impaired and with how difficult is is for her getting around and to do her everyday things she may need the assistance, especially if it ends up flooding again like it did in 20111 and again in 2022 I would like for not just my mum but any disabled person to be able to have access to this application as it would greatly benefit a lot of people, not just in the Australian community but also Globally so a disabled persons day to day life doesn’t have any complications.</p>
</p>The basis of this application is to be entrepreneurial as a non-profitable gift to the disabled community however, if in the future if a business opportunity should arise, I would take that under consideration.
