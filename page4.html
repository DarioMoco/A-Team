<p><i><h3>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers? </p></i></h3><br>

<p>All group members: </p>

 <p>3-5 years’ experience has the most positions taken according to Burning glass but still there was a 198 jobs advertised which had no experience acceptance. </p><br>

 <p><i><h3>How do  the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</p></i></h3><br>

<p>Dario:</p>
<p> Out of the Generic skills set, most demanding for my perfect job were: communication skills, solving problems and work in teams.</p>

<p>Out of IT skills required: software engineering and Linux were somewhere in a middle, but Windows was up to the top. Programing languages required for my perfect job were also towards the top. </p><br>

<p>Kunpeng (Kevin): </p>

<p>There are four key skills that required for Software engineer: ability to learn, computer programming, documentation, and communication. The communication is the basic skill for all the IT professions, because most of the works are teamwork, everyone should know how to deal the problem with others. So, communication is going to be the top. And the next one is the computer programming, which is very important for a Software engineer. If I can proficiently use these languages, I would finish the work on time. As the programming tools are keep updating in the future, Software engineer has to be ready to learn new concepts.</p><br>

<p> Aaron:</p>

<p>There are many key needed skills for being a network analyst including the requirement that you must have a bachelor's degree in IT but some if not all of the most important skills are listed below</p>

<p>-An extensive and current knowledge of hardware, software, and programming.</p>

<p>-An ability to explain technical information to non-technical people.</p>

<p>-Excellent communications skills.</p>

<p>-Good negotiating skills.</p>

<p>-A good business understanding.</p>

<p>-Teamworking and team management experience.</p><br>

<p>Lachlan:</p>

<p>It appears employers are looking for a broad knowledge of programming languages such as C++, C# and Unity. Along with this previous experience applying these languages to practical applications (such as previous games or software) are very important to employers.</p>
<p>In a role such as lead gameplay designer, communication seems a very important skill demanded by employers as this is integral to the role.</p><br>



<p><i><h3>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</p></i></h3><br>

<p>Dario:</p>
<p> SQL, Java Script, SAP </p><br>

<p>Kunpeng(Kevin):</p>
<p>HTML, CSS and ASP These languages are basically used on Wed development, they are not very related to software development. </p><br>

<p>Aaron:</p>
<p> Html, C, Java, C++, Lua, these are the languages that are used with most network analyst related tasks.</p><br>

<p>Lachlan:</p>
<p>-Programming experience with multiple languages. (C++,C# and Unity).</p>

<p>-Experience with backend services.</p>

<p>-Experience with game assets.</p><br>



<p><i><h3>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set? </p></i></h3><br>

<p>Dario:</p>
<p> Writing, Research, Mentoring </p><br>

<p>Kunpeng(Kevin):</p>
<p>High level writing skill, service skill and searching skill. As the Software engineers are normally work with computer, they do not really need to do much consumer service and they do not have to impressive people by writing an excellent report. There is not much researching work for Software engineer.
