<p>Our respected guest was Mr.Emmet.</p>
<p>Emmet is product manager for a project management tool called Hassle.</p>
<p>Interview was great first-hand experience for us to talk to someone who is involved in IT industry.
He works in small company with small teams and job description would be a development of that particular tool through his own company and users. The way they do it is through constant talk and support and experience on the field. Great thing is that they are using their own product which makes their experience better in terms of offering it to someone else.</p>
<p>The better description would be: that his role is a middle man between development, design and strategy of the tool on one side and end users on the other.
That brings us to second part of his job which is making videos about product and all conclusions from the field. Then they can be used by the current and future customers, not just as promotional material but as a help tool.
Emmet’s background in animation,video production and podcasting helped him to incorporate that part into his day to day work.</p>
<p>Clients of his company are mostly small companies which are doing creative works: photography agencies, small business photographers etc.</p>
<p>His company use Amazon Web services to host all their work which is a cloud computing platform and combination of all three aspects: Iaas, PaaS, SaaS.
They are supplying organization tools such as compute power, database storage and content delivery services.</p>
<p>Emmet’s personal way to this role was pretty interesting from doing customer support, through finishing his school in video production and animation. At some point he has done some teaching too. It created it’s way through to position he enjoys now and helped him to do easier todays day job.</p>
<p>His opinion is that software development has the brightest position in IT jobs spectrum.
Very interesting thoughts he has on design side of IT business where he thinks that designers and artist are less sought than for example coders or people whose skills are just more connected to execution of other peoples ideas which are usually fullfiling customers needs.</p>
