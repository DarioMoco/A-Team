    <p>These are our individual reflections on our Team work on Assignment 2 and a group
reflection as a team aswell.</p>
    <main>
	 <p><b><u>Lachlan Cottrell</u><b></p><br>

   <p>This experience with the A Team has been a good one. I feel very lucky to be put with such agreeable and friendly individuals. I feel as if we have bonded as a group very well, every group meeting has been enjoyable, and everyone is very understanding. In one of our earliest meetings Dario mentioned something that not only has stayed with me but encapsulates my own feelings very well. He said, “Let’s work to make this a great atmosphere”. I think that’s exactly what we have done.</p>

<p>We could’ve improved on communication methods. Using solely Microsoft teams doesn’t allow for good communication if someone is able to access their computer. This is the only thing I can think of that would’ve made my experience better, as this is just our first attempt I think this is a real positive.</p>

<p>I was surprised at how easily we got along, we are all at different stages of our lives and from very different places. This didn’t affect our synchronisation at all, it’s been an absolute pleasure to get to know my group.</p>

<p>I learnt that group assignments don’t always have to be a negative experience. I have had bad experiences in the past, this was completely different. Again, I feel very lucky to have such a good group.</p><br>

<p>Kunpeng XU:</p>
<p>Kunpeng’s test results show an introverted yet assertive individual with a preference for
visual learning. I think this combination of personality traits is great in a group environment,
he’s very unlikely to speak excessively. When he does speak though, everyone will listen as he
is indicated to be a person careful with his words.</p>
<p>Dario Moconja:</p>
<p>In looking at Dario’s test results, he is a born leader. I think his personality suits that of a
group leader perfectly, having an assertive yet intuitive personality is very useful when it
comes to making sure work is completed on time.</p>
<p>Lachlan Cottrell:</p>
<p>Lachlan’s test results show that he is an Introverted Creativity inspired individual with a
preference for Auditory learning, I think this combination of personality traits is great in a
group environment, he’s very likely to share his idea’s and options to develop a more creative
and interactive way to a project</p><br>

<p><b><u>Kunpeng Xu (Kevin)</u></b></p><br>

<p>I feel very lucky to be part of this group, everyone is very nice. Especially Dario, he has been leading each of us to continuous improvement.</p>
<p> During the group discussion, each of us patiently listened to everyone's suggestions and finally made a reasonable decision. Everyone in our group was able to complete their respective tasks within the allotted time because each of us had a high passion to complete the assignment. Before the job starts, we also have a detailed work plan, which is perfect, because it allows each of us to participate.</p>
<p> But we still have some flaws, that is, there are times when someone can't make it to the group meeting on time. But they are not do it as purpose, and every time there is a reasonable explanation for the situation. These situations are understandable, but I think it still affects the outcome of some discussions. Since this was a group of four, it wasn't a huge number. If one or two people are not involved, it can make some decisions difficult for the group to make.</p><br>

<p><b><u>Dario Moconja</u></b></p><br>
<p>As A Team Leader in this group I must say that I had a great experience during the period of our work together.</p>
<p>Team Members were great and cooperative, which led us to finish all our tasks as we were planned.</p>
<p>Issues with time and technology are always present and they didn’t past our group and I understand that is ongoing work and something which is usual part of such work.</p>
<p>Lachlan is amazing team player and his efforts were one of the most important parts of our final outcome. Great personality and very organised and valuable part of any team he might appear on.</p>
<p>Kevin started a bit shy at the beginning but then evolved into perfect team member. All tasks done on time with great intuitive but calm personality. I can see a huge potential in his future endeavours.</p>
</p>Aaron is a team member who had a bit of issues with his time and technology and I understand that’s something which is out of our hands sometimes. Also on the other hand we have to try to minimize those kinds of issues if we want to be serious participants in the game of building stuff within the team. Otherwise great intuitive and inventive personality with a lot of potential for the future if directed, led and encouraged into productive environment.</p>
